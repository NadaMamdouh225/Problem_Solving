Problem
Given a number (greater than 2), print two prime numbers whose sum will be equal to given number, else print -1 if no such number exists.

If [a, b] is one solution with a <= b, and [c, d] is another solution with c <= d, and a < c then print [a, b] only
and not all possible solutions.
Input:
The first line contains an integer T, depicting total number of test cases. Then following T lines contains an integer N.

Output:
Print the two prime numbers in a single line with space in between.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 50
2 ≤ N ≤ 1000000
